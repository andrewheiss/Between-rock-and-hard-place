      List of all NGOs with ECOSOC consultative status
    notes: >-
      The list on the website is actually incomplete. Roughly 400 NGOs do not
      have the year they received ECOSOC status. The PDF list at
      http://csonet.org/content/documents/E-2014-INF-5%20Issued.pdf includes
      all dates, but it's a PDF (!)
