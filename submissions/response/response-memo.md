# Additional literature

> **Editor:** *Reviewers 2 and 3 suggest citing and engaging with additional authors. I'd highlight espeically newly published books by Brass (2016) and Cloward (2016). See also the suggested references listed by both reviewers. *

> **Reviewer 3:** *In addition to the IR literature on NGOs, there is an extensive international development literature, some of which should be included. For example, the seminal work by Edwards and Hulme (1996) and their 20-years later follow on with Banks (2015), both published in World Development, and some of the work on NGO accountability by Alnoor Ibrahim, Mary Kay Gugerty or Aseem Prakash. This would help them flesh out some of the arguments presented in their frame. I would also recommend acknowledging some of the arguments that don't support some of their claims, such at Tim Buthe's work in International Organizations (with colleagues). There is also a comparative politics literature related to NGOs that would be of use and touches on the NGO-state issues in particular. Rebecca Abers and Margaret Keck's Practical Authority (and a number of articles) and Jennifer Brass's new Cambridge book on NGO-government relations, for example, both deal with the role of NGOs in influencing government decision or in making the decisions themselves. They both identify patterns like Teets' argument around the world. This matters because the manuscripts says that Teets' finding is based on "the experience of a handful of NGOs working on environmental issues" (12), but in fact there is an extensive literature on this issue around the world. (More on Teets below.) Karisa Cloward's work on Kenyan NGOs may also be relevant, and sits between IR and Comparative. *

We missed a significant body of literature on how NGOs work with their host governments and shape public policy in partnership with them, in particular in the field of international development. To remedy this, we added several references to this research. Teets's argument remains significant in light of this research, however, as the development literature looks at how NGOs get involved in government decision making in general, while Teets examines how INGOs shape INGO and civil society regulations specifically.

> A substantial body of work has looked at how NGOs influence the laws and policies of the countries they work in, with research showing that NGOs can both roll back and participate directly in government programs (Hulme and Edwards 1997), partner directly with governments to design and implement state policies (Banks, Hulme, and Edwards 2015; Brass 2012), supply employees for government agencies (Cloward 2016), and assist with government policy learning and implementation more generally (Brass 2016). However, prior to Teets, little research has analyzed the ability of NGOs to shape the laws regulating the civil society sector itself, as INGOs in China have

---- 

> **Reviewer 1:** *Reference Carothers report and Closing Space initiative in future research section*

We added a reference to the Carnegie Endowment's ongoing Closing Space initiative in the conclusion:

> Given the rise of INGO regulations around the world and the increasingly closed space for civic engagement (Carothers 2015; Carothers and Brechenmacher 2014), these questions are particularly pressing today.

---- 

> **Reviewer 1:** *Etzioni seems a bit dated, and the idea of NGOs supposing to represent public interest seems naïve—or to buy into NGO’s own PR*

We agree that the reference to Etzioni is dated. However, it is also provides the canonical definition of the dual constraints facing the third sector, laying out the idea that nonprofits should be like businesses and governments at the same time. We use Etzioni to introduce the idea that there are other competing constraints that go beyond the foundational expectations of how the sector should behave, and we introduce two of them in our review: donor norms and host-country regulations. We therefore request that the reference remain.

---- 

> **Reviewer 2:** *Finally, it might be worth adding a line or two on other ways that home states also might influence NGO/INGO style and approach. See: Sarah S. Stroup and Amanda Murdie. 2012. "There's no place like home: Explaining international NGO advocacy." The Review of International Organizations 7 (4): 425-448. *

We agree that home countries are an important source of institutional influence on INGO behavior. Sarah Stroup's recent *Borders among Activists* convincingly makes this argument, as does her ongoing work with Amanda Murdie. We added a couple sentences to the introduction mentioning this. However, because our review looks primarily at the influence of *host* countries rather than home countries, we do not explore this topic much further.

> NGOs that work internationally face additional constraints on their activities. Although they work outside their home countries, international NGOs (INGOs) are beholden to (and shaped by) the laws, regulations, and norms of those countries (Stroup 2012; Stroup and Murdie 2012). 

# Additional critique

> **Editor:** *Reviewer 1 notes that including critical discussion of the books would be helpful (see #12). In particular the relative value of the empirical evidence provided by each author. Should readers understand each book as substantiating its claims equally?*

> **Reviewer 1:** *I wonder whether a bit more of a critical edge would be helpful. All three books seem to have strengths and weaknesses. As someone who has not read any of the books, I found much more about the former than the latter. That may be fine, but in a few areas, more critique might raise questions helpful to readers—and point to important conceptual or methodological issues.*

We added some discussion at the end of each book review section about how convincingly each book substantiates its claims.

---- 

> **Reviewer 1:** *Teets discussion also good, but I wonder whether the book merits further critique based on the brief mention of a need for “scope conditions” in further research. How sweeping are her conclusions? It sounds like the book is a careful, if limited set of case studies about a relatively narrow, “technical” issue—environmentalism—for which authoritarian govts could use outside and independent help. If she limits her broader conclusions about civil society to such sectors, that seems reasonable. If her conclusions cover all manner of CSOs, including human rights and democratization NGOs, that seems more doubtful. Depending on the scope of her claims, further critique may be in order.*

We clarified the scope conditions of Teets's main argument, emphasizing that it is clearly limited to a subset of INGOs working in China. 

> In the book's final chapter, Teets offers a preliminary application of her theory to several other cases, showing how the urge to regulate civil society has diffused…

> Teets’ argument that INGOs can influence regulations is exciting, but it is worth recalling that it is based on the experiences of a handful of NGOs working on environmental issues, and as such, the specific mechanisms of consultative authoritarianism might not apply to other political contexts.

---- 

> **Reviewer 1:** *The Murdie discussion seems to pull its punches: from what I can tell she has a sophisticated theoretical approach, but it is tested almost completely by statistical means, using data that (inevitably as the authors point out) is not particularly good. There seems to have been no effort to do case studies to see whether the statistical findings hold water. This seems more problematic than the authors are willing to state. Playing with stats seems very much divorced from the weeds that Teets and Bush play in. Murdie’s signaling data also seems questionable: ECOSOC status?? To my knowledge, and as the authors state, that is extremely easy to obtain and would constitute only a weak, low-cost signal. (I’d drop some of the later questions related to ECOSOC status for this reason.) As a result of this, discussion at top of 18 gets a bit fuzzy. From what I can tell, Bush is pointing to a much more significant factor than Murdie, whereas the authors seem to portray them as equivalent.*

> **Reviewer 3:**  *I might add that Murdie would have also benefitted from field research to complement her findings.*

We substantially expanded our critique of Murdie's over reliance on statistics, overly broad measures, and signals that might not be signals (like ECOSOC status), and also mention the absence of field work:

> Murdie does supplement the statistical analysis with interesting micro case studies throughout, but these examples are far less detailed or convincing than the case studies provided by Bush and Teets, who both wade deeper into the details of the effects of INGO programming. Future research would benefit from more micro-level data or field research to better understand subtler ideas articulated in Murdie’s larger—and quite engaging—theoretical discussion.

> …

> She carefully reframes the principledness of INGOs as yet another factor that influences their effectiveness rather than as an underlying assumption of their behavior. However, this finding must be balanced by the fact that ECOSOC status might not be a useful signal of principles. Murdie claims that the consultative status program “could be argued to be the longest and well-known of any voluntary accountability program” for international NGOs (Murdie 2014, 70), but ECOSOC rarely turns down applications for consultative status (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs 2016), and the UN’s directory of ECOSOC-affiliated organizations is not completely reliable: in mid-2016, more than 160 of the 2,000 international and regional organizations with ECOSOC status were defunct or uncontactable (Heiss 2016b). While ECOSOC status is a longstanding system for INGO accountability, it is still unclear how credible the status is as a motivational signal for donors.

# Argument


> **Editor:** *Reviewer 3 points to a tension between your emphasis on increasing government regulation/monitoring of INGOs and Teets' work showing NGOs' ability to influence the Chinese government. Perhaps you can briefly address this tension briefly, or clarify if you do not see a point of tension there.*

> **Reviewer 3:** *More importantly, I am concerned that Teets' book, and your review of it, undermines the argument that you propose. Whereas your argument is focused on increased regulation and monitoring by governments, one of Teets' main points is that NGOs can also influence states - even in one of the most authoritarian countries on earth. I am not convinced it fits the framework, and recommend a reconsideration of the framework and/or Teets' place in it. Dig into the ideas of "reverse cooptation" that you discuss more, and perhaps use it to problematize your framing of what's actually happening in the world. What we may be seeing is a process of mutual learning between and among NGOs, donors and states, rather than just NGOs being affected by the others. *

We feel that this objection is a function of having the framework figure be too simple—there is no room in the framework as submitted and reviewed to account for reverse co-optation, even though much of our review of Teets hangs on the idea that INGOs are shaped by and shape the regulations they face. We explore this tension in the review already, but this idea of reverse cooptation was not as prominent.

We clarify our argument by (1) enhancing the figure to include arrows indicating the possibility of reverse cooptation, with INGOs influencing both their host governments and their donors (and we note that the influence on donor norms is almost completely unexplored), and (2) rephrasing and rewriting part of the Teets review to be more explicit about this phenomenon.

> Using strong qualitative research, *Civil Society under Authoritarianism* convincingly demonstrates that government regulations on NGOs indeed constrain NGO behavior, but also that, to a certain extent, NGOs can shape those regulations and constraints to their own benefit. (shown with the dotted arrow in Figure 2).

---- 

> **Editor:** *Reviewer 3 suggests expanding your discussion of possibilities for future research focusing on NGOs means of signaling to donors at the bottom of p.17*

> **Reviewer 3:** *On a positive note, I found the argument you make on the last paragraph of page 17 to be really important and novel - bring this out more! *

> **Reviewer 1:** *17-18: adjusting/signaling seem so different that there would seem no reason to think they could not both occur—although I think adjusting is much more important.*

We expanded our discussion of signaling and adjusting in the conclusion and now argue that INGO signaling (such as obtaining ECOSOC status) is a low-cost, low-impact adjustment in strategy or programming, thus addressing Reviewer 1's concern. This expansion hopefully paves the way for future work on other signals, especially given the potential weakness in Murdie's use of ECOSOC status as a sign of NGO principledness: 

> It may be that Murdie’s signaling is a type of low-cost adjustment, similar to donor demands of measurable programs, allowing NGOs to make minor modifications to their strategy to potentially gain access to more donor resources without running the risk of taming their programming. Can NGOs substitute simpler signaling strategies for more complicated changes in behavior? (i.e. can obtaining ECOSOC status help preclude the possibility that an INGO’s programming could be tamed by further donor demands?) Are INGOs aware of donor preferences when signaling or adjusting, or are there information asymmetries? (i.e. do donors really care about ECOSOC status or detailed program metrics?) 

---- 

> **Reviewer 3:** *On page 4, the authors seem to have an extensive conversation about a well-known phenomenon, mission drift, but do not use this term. Related to this however, in the same section, I would like to see the argument fleshed out more. It sounds like they are saying that mission drift toward donor (rather than NGOs own) priorities causes NGOs to not fulfill their missions, but I am not seeing what the causal mechanism is. Is there a way to spell this out more? *

We explain the mechanism of mission drift more fully in a few additional sentences: 

> Distortions and competition in the market for INGO funding ultimately reorient NGO missions toward *donor* priorities—and away from *NGO* preferences—causing gaps in which kinds of advocacy and services are provided (Witesman and Heiss 2016). In an effort to chase available money, INGOs can drop highly valued, but underfunded objectives in favor of issues that align more closely with the preferences of available donors (Cooley and Ron 2002). 

---- 

> **Reviewer 3:** *Admitting that this may be an issue of preference, I find there to be far too many open-ended questions throughout the paper. While I realize these exist to raise questions that the authors may not be able to answer (in places) or are used as rhetorical devices (in others), the manuscript would be stronger if the authors pushed into some of the issues they raise and provided new insights and analysis instead of just questions. At the set of them on page 8, I found myself writing in the margins, "unclear how these are supposed to be used - revise for clarity/connection to arguments."*

We feel that one of the purposes of this review is to open up new questions and fields of research on the institutional constraints and influences on INGO behavior, and we purposely included many open-ended questions for this purpose. We did remove or combine several questions, though, since there were, admittedly, quite a few.

# Framing

> **Editor:** *Reviewer 2 points to a central question that is not fully addressed in your article: do NGOs achieve their goals, or do they do more harm than good? *

> **Reviewer 2:** Harm vs. good question: *Certainly, this is the question that the book by Murdie is concerned with and by more clearly focusing on that question and the literature tied to the question, the review would provide a more complete overview of this new niche of scholarship on NGO/INGOs. This could easily be added as a third topic of the review without adding too much more text.*

> **Reviewer 2:** *the last section of the article on future research could also be tightened up and include mention of exploring other possible approaches for assessing or understanding NGO effectiveness (e.g. building on Murdie's approach).*

Our most substantive revisions address this harm vs. good question. In the section reviewing Murdie's work, we explore the dichotomy between harmful and good NGOs and find that while many scholars rely on this comparison, it is not entirely appropriate. When scholars refer to harmful activities, they generally mean "the absence of help" rather than intentional harm. Assessing actual harm is difficult and none of these books attempt to address that. We then look at one reason that measuring harm is difficult—INGO time horizons and strategies are long and nuanced. An INGO might purposely work in an autocracy, lending the regime reputational advantages and possibly imposing some "harm" on human rights advocacy in that country. But the organization's continued presence in the country can set the stage for more progressive human rights work later on, resulting in more helpful programming years later.

> Murdie’s argument rests on an underlying dichotomy of harm and good, which she references directly in her title—INGO strategies will either result in net positive (help) or net negative (harm) changes in human rights and service provision in target countries. Our framework helps explain the dual institutional pressures INGOs face, and how these pressures can affect NGO operations. Less restrictive regulations and donor requirements can enable INGOs to do more good with their activities. Conversely, more restrictive environments can distort the strategies of INGOs, taming their programming and bringing their activities in line with the government’s stability-seeking calculus. However, whether this ultimate causes harm by actually exacerbating conditions or prolonging bad regimes is an open question that none of the books address empirically. Furthermore, whether they produce more harm than good is an even harder question to answer as it entails not only measuring both harm and good as well as establishing causality, but it also entails weighing disparate outcomes against one another, which requires difficult normative judgments.

> Indeed, while this dichotomy of help and harm raises useful questions, it is an incomplete comparison and its not clear that the term “harm” is defined or applied properly. Importantly, the absence or reduction of good (help) cannot not be equated with harm. When democracy assistance organizations tame their programming, or when INGOs purposely align themselves with government preferences, they reduce the amount of helpful programing they provide. However, merely being ineffective is not the same as being harmful and actually causally assessing the level of harm stemming from these decisions is difficult and requires careful and detailed evidence, which goes beyond the scope of these books (and indeed, most research on INGO programming). 

We revisit this dichotomy in the conclusion to the review, observing again that it is difficult to truly assess harm, especially when considering more nuanced long-term INGO strategies:

> However, looking for potential distortions in INGO priorities is difficult because of the nuanced logic and longer perspective of INGO decision making. For instance, while taming democracy assistance is arguably less helpful on its face, INGOs often willingly tame their programs to gain or maintain access to a hard-to-reach country and instead play a long game to maximize the good they can do in that country (Heiss 2016b). Actions that appear to harm activism or service provision in the short term can enable more helpful work later on. Beyond issues of time horizons, it is possible that many INGOs—in particular those that do not deal directly with democracy promotion—are less affected by taming and other potential programmatic distortions because of their underlying missions. Service provision NGOs (Murdie’s freedom-from-want NGOs) often simply want to relieve human suffering. If pursuing good entails supporting or tacitly propping up nondemocratic regimes (thereby harming future advocacy), NGOs can still achieve their goals even though the government stays in power. Here, weighing the cost of potentially prolonging the duration of an autocratic regime against the benefit of alleviating human suffering becomes a deep moral dilemma. Scholars therefore must use caution in claiming that harm has occurred and weigh such questions in the context of explicit empirical and normative frameworks.

---- 

> **Editor:** *Reviewer 3 questions why your focus is solely on INGOs instead of also including national NGOs. A brief discussion of this would be helpful.*

> **Reviewer 3:** *It is not clear to me, however, why the authors single out international NGOs, as opposed to all NGOs. From my related work on the subject, I know that most national NGOs in many countries face these exact constraints, including in some of the places studied in the books under review - and some of Teets own work details Chinese NGOs. There's also a question to me if what you are discussing is large organizations or big-budget organizations, since those are the ones that tend to do things like have UN consultative status. What is it about being "international that matters? More justification is needed for this decision.*

We added a few sentences in the introduction describing some of the additional constraints that *international* NGOs face that complicate their activities more than domestic NGOs, namely the competing legal environments of their home and host countries:

> NGOs that work internationally face additional constraints on their activities. Although they work outside their home countries, international NGOs (INGOs) are beholden to (and shaped by) the laws, regulations, and norms of those countries (Stroup 2012; Stroup and Murdie 2012). In addition, in order to engage in advocacy or provide services in sovereign states, INGOs must also adhere to the legal regulatory environment of the states they target—or risk losing access to the country. However, if the regulatory environment is too restrictive, INGOs may be unable to effectively pursue their missions.

# Miscellaneous editorial issues


## Definitions

> **Reviewer 3:**  *The use of the word "donor" should be clearly defined near the beginning. In most studies (not about philanthropy), donor implies state or multi-state organizations such as USAID, the World Bank, DIFD, etc. In some of these works, and in the usage here, donor can also mean large non-profits like NED that fund smaller non-profits. (I was confused about this upon seeing Figure 1, as I initially read it as meaning that the # of professionalized employees at a nonprofit like NED could be used as a proxy measure for demands by the US government.) These types of organizations likely have different funding patterns and organizational priorities. They are also themselves subject to the whims of their donors, making the argument a bit more convoluted than presented.*

We rephrased the second paragraph of the review to include a list of example donors, including national agencies, IGOs, and large foundations:

> The growth in data and indicators has been remarkable (Kelley and Simmons 2015) and has reshaped the norms that dictate how donor organizations—including national agencies like the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the UK's Department for International Development (DFID), international governmental organizations like the World Bank, and large philanthropic foundations like the National Endowment for Democracy (NED)—distribute funding to recipient NGOs. These donors are increasingly demanding evidence for the effectiveness of policies that are no longer meant simply to prop up friendly regimes.

---- 

> **Reviewer 3:**  *Define "NGO scramble" on p. 6 for those new to the NGO literature.*

We define NGO scramble by rephrasing a few sentences in our review of Bush:

> Through this analysis, she provides convincing evidence that the structures and institutions for grant-making have changed drastically in ways that directly shape NGO behavior. Her findings uncover one of the mechanisms behind the idea of an “NGO scramble”, or the theory that increased competition among NGOs would lead to more uncertainty, competition, insecurity, and ineffectiveness in the sector (Cooley and Ron 2002).

---- 

> **Reviewer 3:** *Likewise, I found the use of "freedom-from-want NGOs" and similar construction to be very awkward and non-intuitive. Use quotes or re-write into simple English.*

In our review of Murdie's book, we tend to use the freedom-from-want and freedom-from-fear phrasing, mostly because that's how she refers to the two sectors. It's admittedly unwieldy, but it matches her discussion of the dichotomy. When introducing the ideas, we now include parenthetical explanations that freedom-from-want entails service provision and freedom-from-fear entails advocacy.


## Clarification

> **Reviewer 1:** *Discussion of Bush generally clear and good. But I’d like to know what she is comparing the new, tamer DA NGOs to. Which prior DA practices were effective? Which prior DA cases really worked in the past—which countries can we point to as more democratic thanks to U.S. DA? How could we even know that prior approaches worked if NGOs were not measured or their prior activities were not measurable? Could that undermine some of her “scathing critique” of DA’s taming?*

> **Reviewer 1:**  *6: One sentence of examples of current practice in democ assistance would help (before “She bolsters . . .”). Possibly also a sentence contrasting to older practices (if Bush provides them). Readers will want to know specifically what constitutes “taming”—even before reading the book.*

We added some examples and explanation of what pre-taming programming looked like, such as the NED's programs to fund political dissidents: 

> For instance, in the 1980s the NED supported and funded dozens of foreign NGOs and dissidents that directly challenged dictators and repressive regimes, but in the intervening decades, donors have become more likely to fund NGOs that offer more technical and less confrontational programming like improving local governance. Donor demands for measurability and logic models have led many NGOs to shift their core programming to activities that allow them to quantify their inputs, outputs, and outcomes and facilitate statistical evaluations for their donors.

---- 

> **Reviewer 1:**  *7: the meaning of sentence critiquing Bush for “steady time trend” data eludes me; probably rewrite. The whole para is a bit too technical for readers who mostly won’t have the book in front of them. I’d shorten and clarify it in nontechnical terms*

This paragraph is technical, but because it is our main critique of the book, we would like to keep it in. We rephrased the sentence in question to be more accessible and clear, though:

> However, because neither variable varies between countries, the effect of the variables is indistinguishable from other time trends.

---- 

> **Reviewer 3:**  *I found the summaries of both Bush and Teets to be largely accurate and easy to follow, but the paragraph on Murdie's book (middle of p. 14) may not be clear to readers who are not immersed in this literature. Explain how Murdie uses the several instruments, for example.*

As with our discussion of Bush's statistical approach, one of our main critiques of Murdie's book is her use of statistics, which implies a more technical discussion of quantitative methods. We simplified our critique and added a clearer and more explicit explanation of instrumental variables:

> To address the causal effects of programming—a challenge, given that NGOs are not randomly assigned to the countries or issues they work on—the book employs two-stage least square regression using several instruments, or variables that predict the outcome variable only through a given explanatory variable, including the annual percent increase in telephone mainlines (to predict the effect of INGOs on improving women’s rights and physical integrity rights) and both the number of tourism arrivals in a country and the annual percent change in access to an improved water source (to predict the effect of INGOs on improving access to potable water). Based on these models, she concludes that INGOs tend to help far more than harm, and that service and advocacy INGOs have improved human security outcomes. It should be noted, however, that none of the outcome measures capture harm, but only the degree of good provided. Additionally, the instrumental variables used may not all meet the requirements that they only affect the outcome through the independent variable—especially since one is a lag of the dependent variable itself. Accordingly, the variables might provide less solid analytical foundations than the conclusions suggest.


## Phrasing

> **Reviewer 1:**  *4: do donors distort NGO behavior causing competition? Needs rephrasing because it is not even “inadvertently” that they do so. Instead, it seems built into any market-like relationship. No one is at fault, and no inadvertence is present.*

We removed "inadvertent", replaced with "market-based", since these distortion effects can happen whenever relationships are marketized.

> Instead of a strong grassroots civil society with robust and independent NGOs, donors created a market-based “professionalized realm of NGOs…

---- 

> **Reviewer 1:**  *18: “She finds . . .” sentence unclear. Perhaps it is Murdie’s findings themselves, but I think what it “impl[ies]” needs clarification. The subsequent points about lighter regulations and govt discretion are very sensible—and potentially add to a critique of Murdie’s conclusions. The later sentences on Teets’ grounded approach and on de jure vs de facto policies are also important and again seem to suggest problems in Murdie’s view.*

We spell out more clearly what Murdie's findings imply: 

> She finds that advocacy INGOs are most effective when working in countries that host other internationally focused INGOs and concludes that this is a sign that effective work on issues that have broad, unified domestic support. However, as noted previously, this concentration of INGOs might also be due to these countries' more liberal regulations towards foreign organizations and not necessarily because these states support INGO agendas.

---- 

> **Reviewer 1:**  *19-20: The “clumping” effect: is this just a function of lighter regulations?*

The sentence following the phrase in question offers two possible explanations: perhaps donors like to fund NGOs in places where there's a critical mass, or perhaps because there are lighter regulations ("more conducive to activism" as we say). To remedy future concerns or misunderstandings, we add an additional sentence to this section:

> If so, are NGOs searching under the lamppost, flocking to countries with the lightest regulations?


## Minor reviewer-suggested edits

> **Reviewer 1:**  *1 “straddling” seems the wrong word, suggesting that they partake of both, when I’d say they are usually distinct.*

We replaced "straddling" with with "situated between" to show that they don't necessarily partake of both sectors, but that they have structural elements of both sectors.

> Situated between the private sector and the government, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are ideally expected to reflect the best of both worlds…

---- 

> **Reviewer 1:**  *12: “important [questions]”*

We added the missing word "questions."

---- 

> **Reviewer 1:**  *Figure 2: not really needed; the concepts are easy to understand without it.*

> **Reviewer 3:**  *I'm not sure Figure 2 really provides anything that isn't clear from the text. I leave it to the editor's discretion on this.*

Both Reviewer 1 and 3 requested that we remove the figure, but we would prefer to keep it for two reasons: (1) it adds didactic value to the paper and makes the concepts more accessible, and (2) we modified the figure slightly to show more nuance in our overall frame, accounting for Teets' argument of reverse cooptation and showing a possible avenue of future research wherein donors can be influenced by the NGOs they donate to.

---- 

> **Reviewer 3:** *There are points of considerable repetition in the manuscript. I believe that the authors are trying to simplify reading by summarizing each section, but since the arguments are not that complex, it feels more like redundancy than summary. I would remove these summarizing sections, and use the space freed up to strengthen the framing, literature review and arguments. Or add another book, perhaps.*

For stylistic reasons, we prefer the summaries.

# Housekeeping

In addition to these reviewer suggestions, we made the following minor changes:

- Corrected typographic errors and finalized editing
- Formatted the manuscript so that it follows APSA style guidelines as closely as possible
- Unblinded the manuscript
- Added correct links to the replication repository
