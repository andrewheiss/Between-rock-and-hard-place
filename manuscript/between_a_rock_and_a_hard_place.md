The nonprofit world labors under multiple constraints. Straddling the private sector and the government, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are expected to reflect the best of both worlds, combining the "efficiency and expertise from the business world with public interest, accountability, and broader planning from government" [@Etzioni:1973, 315]. If NGOs behave too much like private sector businesses and engage in resource-maximizing behavior, they can drift from their deeper missions. At the same time, if NGOs disregard market forces in favor of only serving the public interest and advancing their deeply held ideals, they put their financial survival at risk. International NGOs (INGOs) face additional external constraints—in order to engage in advocacy or provide services in sovereign states, INGOs must adhere to the legal regulatory environment of those states. If INGOs disregard the organizational regulations of their host countries, they risk losing access to the country. However, if the regulatory environment is too restrictive, INGOs may be unable to effectively pursue their missions. This conflict between an INGO's ideals and the institutional environments it operates in gives rise to a strategy @MitchellSchmitz:2014 have termed *principled instrumentalism*, where INGOs "pursue their principled objectives within the economic constraints and political opportunity structures imposed by their external environments" (489).

Two of these economic and political opportunity structures—the norms that dictate how donors distribute funding and the legal regulatory environment for civil society in host countries—have changed dramatically over the last few decades. First, as NGOs and civil society actors have repeatedly taken central roles in domestic protests and have been empowered by social media and transnational funding and support, nondemocratic governments have tightened the regulation of these groups within their country. Second, in response to concern about the efficacy of development aid and as part of the push towards evidence-based policy making and accountability, policy makers have created various indicators to improve their ability to evaluate development policy reforms [@Arndt:2008; @ArndtOman:2006]. These include measures such as United Nation Development Programme's *Human Development Report* (1990), and the World Bank's *Governance Indicators* (2002). The growth in data and indicators has been remarkable [@KelleySimmons:2015]. This drive has been accompanied by changes within donor organizations, which are increasingly demanding evidence for the effectiveness of policies that are no longer meant simply to prop up friendly regimes.

![*Left panel*: the cumulative number of countries with laws restricting civil society (source: Christensen and Weinstein 2013); *right panel*: the proportion of National Endowment for Democracy (NED) staff with advanced professional degrees and the proportion of NED grants awarded to programs that are measurable and quantifiable (source: Bush 2015)](../figures/fig-ingos-env.pdf){#fig:constraint-data}

@fig:constraint-data demonstrates how these two environmental pressures have increased over time. The left panel indicates that the legal and regulatory environment for both domestic and international NGOs has become more constrained over time, with an increasing number of countries passing laws that require NGOs to register with the government, prevent NGOs from engaging in certain forms of advocacy, and prohibit NGOs from accepting money from international donors. The right panel shows a similar change in donor demands. Based on data from @Bush:2015, it highlights two characteristics of the National Endowment for Democracy, a critical donor for democracy establishment NGOs: over the past 30 years, more NED staff hold graduate and professional degrees, and more NED grants require that NGOs carefully measure and evaluate the outputs and outcomes of their activities. That is, as donor organizations themselves adopt a culture of professionalization, they raise their demands for NGO accountability, professionalization, and performance. 

This changing environment directly influences the day-to-day operations of NGOs. How do the preferences and behavior of both donor organizations and host countries affect the strategies, activities, and effectiveness of INGOs? Seminal work by @Cooley:2002 has set off a wave of research on the relationship between donors and NGOs, but research is still emerging on the more complex set of relationships between donors, host countries, and NGOs,  how NGOs may have had to adapt, and what such adaptation might mean for their effectiveness.

Recent books by Sarah Bush, Jessica Teets, and Amanda Murdie bring unique ideas and empirical evidence to illustrate different parts of this question. To discuss the arguments in each book, as well as explore incidental ties between the three, we suggest a simple framework for organizing and understanding these dual institutional constraints on INGOs (see [@fig:framework]). In this essay, we use this framework to identify how each book addresses these influences on INGOs and how, in some cases, INGOs can reverse the direction of influence. 

![The dual environmental constraints confronting INGOs](../figures/Framework.pdf){#fig:framework}


# The influence of donor norms

The preferences, rules, and institutions of donors comprise the first significant pressure on NGO activities and behavior. As a corrective to the overly optimistic conception of NGOs as altruistic, high-minded, deeply principled organizations positioned to address critical policy failures [@NyeKeohane:1971; @Skjelsbaek:1971; @Corry:2010], early research began to examine how NGOs shift their priorities away from their core missions, values, and constituents in an effort to secure funding. For instance, in post-Soviet Russia, foreign donors interested in democracy promotion flooded the country's nascent civil society sector with millions of dollars of aid, leading to two diverging outcomes. Foreign donors enhanced NGO organizational capacity by providing them with substantial funding, equipment, and practical training. However, these efforts ultimately weakened the sector, as recipient NGOs linked themselves to foreign donors in patron-client relationships [@Henderson:2002]. Instead of a strong grassroots civil society with robust and independent NGOs, donors inadvertently created a "professionalized realm of NGOs, inaccessible to most local groups and compromised by its links to a neoliberal vision of development" [@Hemment:2004, 215]. Similar distortions—NGOs becoming overly linked to their donors—have occurred throughout the world, including countries like Ghana, India, Mexico [@Townsend:2004], Palestine [@Jamal:2007], and Haiti [@Schuller:2012].

In addition to restructuring social ties between recipients and their constituents, donors can also inadvertently distort NGO behavior by fostering competition for funding. As similar NGOs compete for the same sources of funding, organizations may undermine their competitors, withhold information, or continue to work on failing (yet profitable) endeavors [@Cooley:2002]. Some NGOs may even exaggerate the severity of crises to obtain additional funding from donors [@CohenGreen:2012]. Though NGOs may initially be motivated by principled agendas, competition in the fundraising market can result in dysfunctional behaviors. NGOs do not operate in a meritocracy of policy issues, where donors immediately support the worthiest human rights and humanitarian problems. Instead, INGOs compete in a "harsh, Darwinian marketplace where legions of desperate groups vie for scarce attention, sympathy, and money" [@Bob:2002, 37]. NGOs that use emotive marketing, employ native English speakers, use charismatic spokespeople, and align their messages with Western sensibilities are far more effective than their competitors at advancing their agenda and securing funding from donors.

In *The Taming of Democracy Assistance*, Sarah Bush makes a novel contribution to this well-established field of donor–NGO research. Using a mix of statistical models and detailed case studies, Bush advances a scathing critique of the democracy promotion establishment by showing how the measurement revolution and rising demand for evidence-based policies has distorted NGOs' core operations. By conditioning their funding on evidence of program effectiveness, donors have incentivized NGOs to reshape their programs to deliver evidence of activity rather than meaningful results. Thus, many NGOs have adapted their core programming to activities that allow them to quantify their inputs, outputs, and outcomes and facilitate statistical evaluations for their donors.

Unfortunately, however, these donor requirements are also less compatible with old-fashioned NGO efforts to promote democracy. In this strained donor environment, the last thing an NGO wants to do is push for too much reform in ways that might jeopardize its ability to work in the country, which in turn weakens its long-term ability to pursue its mission and obtain funding. 

This tension between the need to measure activities and the risks inherent in engaging in those activities leads to Bush's main thesis about the taming of democracy promotion programs. Rather than confront dictators with more radical and risky programming, democracy promotion NGOs that are dependent on foreign donors engage in advocacy that is (1) measurable, thereby appeasing their donors, and (2) regime compatible, thereby keeping their host governments satisfied and allowing them to continue to operate. This mix of competing constraints creates a tamer, watered down version of democracy assistance that fails to provoke meaningful reforms or confront dictators. 

Throughout her book, Bush makes several important empirical and theoretical contributions. First, she notes that despite popular debate about democracy promotion, scholars know very little about how democracy assistance works in practice [@Bush:2015, 213]. She remedies this shortcoming by providing a rich description of how democracy promotion is carried out today, highlighting the work of dozens of donor organizations and NGOs through impressive fieldwork and primary research. Consistent with her theory, she bolsters her qualitative work by quantifying and statistically modeling measurability and regime compatibility of NGO programming, categorizing several thousand grants from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) in a typology of measurability and regime compatibility. Through this analysis, she uncovers one of the mechanisms behind the NGO scramble first theorized by @Cooley:2002, providing convincing evidence that the structures and institutions for grant-making have changed drastically in ways that directly shape NGO behavior.  Both competition *between* NGOs and professionalization *within* NGOs increase the proportion of NGO programming that is measurable and regime-compatible—as organizations scramble among themselves for funds and as organizations become more professional, staffed by more graduate degree holders, NGO programing becomes more tame. 

This insight is hugely important and even paradoxical. Precisely in their effort to engender greater effectiveness, donors—or at least USAID and the NED—are taming the programming they sponsor and pushing dictators less, not more. Their programming may be more effective, but to what end?

Notwithstanding these contributions, the analysis contains some minor shortcomings. Although the book addresses both donor and host government constraints on NGO activities (i.e. both sides of @fig:framework), the bulk of the book's evidence is focused on the institutional pressures from donors, and not from host countries. When government pressures are addressed, the evidence is either inconclusive or only lightly discussed. For example, in the statistical model explaining the determinants of regime compatible programming, both increased competition and professional norms—each aspects of the donor environment—influence the proportion of regime compatible activities. However, both variables are identical in each country-level observation in each year, and thus the finding is essentially a steady time trend following the right panel of [@fig:constraint-data], and as such, may also reflect other concurrent time trends. Meanwhile, regime type (as measured by Freedom House) surprisingly has no effect. Although programming is becoming more technical and less confrontational, we would still expect the mix of NGO programming to be less compatible with more autocratic regimes, and the book'pos later case studies argue as much. Bush does acknowledge this non-relationship briefly and offers an alternative analysis using categorical regime types, but the absence of a significant statistical effect could perhaps be the result of the choice to model regime type as exponential by including a squared term of the Freedom House variable. Indeed, if the relationship is modeled as purely linear, then a significant relationship between autocracy and regime compatibility does emerge, as in Bush's other statistical models.

At its core, Bush's argument is not necessarily about measurement or compatibility per se, but about survival. Survival strategies dictate NGO programming—NGOs measure their outputs and outcomes (and correspondingly tame their programming) because donors require it to receive funding, and NGOs ensure their programs are compatible with the regime (and correspondingly tame their programming) because host governments allow or deny access to their countries. Bush tackles two aspects of survival, but many other strategies remain unexplored and are ripe for future research. While NGOs are certainly driven by instrumental concerns like funding and access, they are also animated by deeper principled motivations [@MitchellSchmitz:2014]. Taming programming for the sake of obtaining funding will inevitably clash with NGO norms. How do NGOs balance the need for funding with the need to promote democracy, challenge undemocratic regimes, or bolster human rights? Do NGOs adjust their principles to square them with their principled behavior, or do they forgo funding or access to remain aligned with their ideals? Additionally, what other instrumental strategies can NGOs engage in? Rather than uniformly tame its programming, an international organization might shift its resources to other countries with more favorable regulatory environments. For example, the Open Society Foundations (OSF)—one of Bush's case study organizations—was expelled from Russia in 2015 after being deemed an "undesirable organization." Instead of taming its programming to stay active in the country, OSF moved its focus to other countries in the region, temporarily abandoning its Russia projects in favor of more effective advocacy and assistance elsewhere [@Heiss:2016b]. 

These questions are clearly beyond the scope of the book and simply illustrate fruitful avenues of future research. Bush usefully makes a strong argument for the first relationship in our framework, demonstrating how the donor environment shapes NGO behavior, and deepening our understanding of how the measurement revolution has unintentionally influenced the content of NGO programming. Her work raises important questions for USAID and the democracy promotion establishment, and is both theoretically interesting and highly policy-relevant. Her treatment of the effect of the second relationship in our framework—how the host country environment influences NGO activities—is more nascent, but it opens the door to future analysis. And indeed, it is a question others have begun to explore.


# The influence of the host country legal environment 

In *Civil Society under Authoritarianism*, Jessica Teets addresses the second relationship in our framework, investigating how the preferences, politics, and legal environment of host countries shape NGO behavior and programming. Teets looks at one of the most interesting cases for INGO activism, namely that of China, where civil society has grown significantly over the last decade as the Chinese government has sought to balance the pressures of economic growth and a wealthier and more educated citizenry. Throughout her book, Teets seeks to resolve a paradox: why does the Chinese communist party allow advocacy NGOs such as Greenpeace to operate in their country? At first glance, it seems that autocrats concerned with survival would not willingly invite foreign organizations that could potentially destabilize and threaten the regime. Indeed, in China, environmental issues are among the most problematic for the government as pollution lowers the quality of life for millions of its citizens and disasters at times enrage localities that suffer significant harm. However, the ruling party has allowed—and even encouraged—the development of foreign-influenced associational life within China. Teets' solution to this paradox is a new model of state–society relations she terms *consultative authoritarianism*, where autocrats encourage the development of a strong and autonomous civil society under the aegis of newer, indirect methods of state control. 

Scholars have identified dozens of authoritarian strategies for survival and stability, each instituted in a top-down manner by the regime. Previous research shows that dictators maintain power by countering threats to their rule with institutionalization. Autocrats establish institutions like consultative councils and executive cabinets to give voice to and build patronage with elites and create democratic-appearing institutions like legislatures, elections, or civil society to manufacture popular loyalty and mitigate threats from society or the opposition [@Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a; @Gandhi:2006; @GandhiPrzeworski:2007; @Brownlee:2007]. Teets' model of consultative authoritarianism falls in this theoretical strain and she shows that the Chinese government has institutionalized civil society in a way to maximize the benefits of NGOs while minimizing the risk. 

Teets helpfully expands this literature on authoritarian institutionalization by investigating the processes behind the creation of civil society regulations. The novelty of her new model of regulation lies in its consultative component. Using carefully selected case studies of government officials and NGOs working in Yunnan, Beijing, Jiangsu and Sichuan provinces, Teets shows that civil society regulations are not created unilaterally by the regime, but are instead the result of a bottom-up dynamic learning process together *with* NGOs. According to her argument, policy makers and bureaucrats who are pressed for time and resources recognize that civil society organizations are useful potential partners in filling gaps in service delivery and policy execution—for example, provinces suffering from severe pollution can enlist the help of expert environmental international NGOs to address those issues. These bureaucrats also establish regulations that attempt to mitigate the potential threat inherent in turning to foreign organizations, including tax laws, registration requirements, and other mechanisms for oversight and accountability. 

Up to this point, the model mimics prior adaptation strategies by dictators. Teets, however, goes further to discuss how civil society reacts, thus offering a more dynamic account. Teets argues that, for their part, NGOs do not passively accept government overtures for collaboration, but instead become co-architects of the regulations [@Teets:2014, 145]. NGOs have a menu of strategies that allow them to create positive experiences for local officials and shape the civil society regulatory environment in beneficial ways. In an act of reverse co-optation [@Najam:2000; @BaurSchmitz:2012], organizations can invite government officials to conferences and workshops, hire retired government officials with connections to sitting bureaucrats, or publicly shame government agencies that impose harsher regulations. In turn, bureaucrats respond by modifying civil society regulations.

This dynamic, consultative relationship between the regime and NGOs is perhaps the book's most groundbreaking theoretical contribution. Teets convincingly demonstrates that government regulations on NGOs indeed constrain NGO behavior, but also that, to a certain extent, NGOs can shape those regulations and constraints to their own benefit.

Teets makes a convincing case for consultative authoritarianism in China—an important case in and of itself, given the significance of China—but it is unclear how well the theory travels to other countries or policy issues. The book's final chapter briefly shows how the urge to regulate civil society has diffused across authoritarian regimes as dozens of countries have enacted laws similar to China's. Indeed, as we showed in @fig:constraint-data, regimes around the world—both democratic and authoritarian—have increased their regulation of civil society. However, not all of these new regulations are designed to allow autocrats to benefit from civil society. In an extended case study in the conclusion, Teets argues that Russia has followed a path similar to China, passing a law in 2006 (in partial consultation with domestic NGOs) that could have possibly strengthened civil society under conditions favorable to the state. However, more recent developments, such as Putin's passage of the 2012 Foreign Agents law and the 2015 Undesirable Organizations law veer from this trend. NGOs did not influence these newer, harsher regulations and Russia now has substantial power over organizations it deems threatening and has prompted the exit of many. 

Teets' argument that INGOs can influence regulations is exciting, but it is worth recalling that it is based on the experiences of a handful NGOs working on environmental issues. This raises important questions for future research about the scope conditions of this phenomenon of reverse influence. When can INGOs working in other policy issues also influence the regulations that govern them? Can NGOs that advocate for more contentious issues, such as human rights, have similar success in consulting with their host governments? What are the consequences of collaboration with autocratic governments? Furthermore, looking to our simple framework in [@fig:framework], how do donors respond when an NGO works closely with dictators? How do NGOs find the right balance between collaboration and independence that satisfies both their own goals and those of their donors? And if INGOs and civil society remain active in authoritarian regimes, what influences can they have on the situation in those countries?

In sum, Teets' book is a remarkable contribution in that it opens up the black box of civil society–government relations in an important repressive regime. The book provides insights about how the Chinese government attempts to balance the many pressures it faces from both domestic and external actors, sets a good example for how similar research might be carried out elsewhere and on other topics, and raises new questions for research.


# Donor and host country influences

*The Taming of Democracy Assistance* and *Civil Society under Authoritarianism* each clearly address individual institutional pressures on NGOs, effectively arguing that both the donor environment and the host country's regulatory environment constrain and shape NGO behavior. While these two books fit squarely in our simple dual-constraint framework, other research on NGO behavior can also be situated within this framework, which can help draw our attention to other effects of donors and host countries on NGOs.

Amanda Murdie's *Help or Harm* is first and foremost focused on understanding the effects of a wide range of NGOs on the countries in which they work. She begins with an ambitious goal of first determining whether NGOs play a positive or negative role in improving human security, and then identifying which conditions allow for such effects. Murdie separates the broad issue of human security into the dual freedoms from both "want" and "fear," which international NGOs address by engaging in service provision (to address want) or human rights advocacy (to address fear). NGO efforts in both these realms influence host countries, but human rights advocacy aims more directly at influencing the host government itself. She presents a creative formal game theoretic model to structure her analysis of how INGOs interact with those other actors in these two sectors, and uses the model's various equilibria to generate hypotheses about the motivations and influences of INGOs. The model reinforces the internal logic of the argument and makes the empirical analysis clear and easy to follow. She ultimately finds that INGOs tend to help far more than harm, and that service and advocacy INGOs have improved human security outcomes.

Murdie explores the conditioning factors for this effects using a set of statistical models and data on over 1,000 NGOs in more than 100 countries. As for the influence of host countries on NGOs, rather than focus on how host country regulations or regime types might constrain NGO behavior, Murdie points to domestic features that present real barriers to NGO effectiveness. She finds that freedom-from-want INGOs are most successful when they work in countries with less corruption, when they garner support from the international donor community, and when they serve domestic populations that have increased access to global civil society (i.e. are more urbanized and legally permitted to participate in associational life) and value the services provided. She finds a different set of conditions facilitate success in advocacy. Similar to their service providing counterparts, freedom-from-fear INGOs are more effective when they have closer connections with domestic populations (i.e. when the citizens of the countries they target have better access to information and contact with the global community). Additionally, these INGOs are most effective when addressing issues that have broad, unified domestic support and that other states, IGOs, and INGOs care about—notably, INGOs that work in countries that play host to other internationally focused INGOs have better success. Finally, INGOs see better human rights outcomes when working in countries that are more economically and politically vulnerable, or that are more dependent on trade and exports. These conditions align well with other research about factors that mediate the effectiveness of external reforms [@LevitskyWay:2006].

The book's emphasis on a handful of practical (and measurable) outcomes and influences reflects an unfortunate lack of INGO-related data in general (a fact with which we are both intimately familiar). Murdie admirably works with these limitations and justifies how each measure she uses proxies for grander outcomes. However, even with these justifications, the depth of the factors discussed in the introductory chapters leaves the reader hoping for more micro-level data, and thus, the macro-level evidence may at times oversell some of its conclusions. For example, Murdie argues that the effectiveness of human rights INGOs depends on the costs of information and social contact with the domestic population. This factor is captured with CIRI's freedom of association measure, a variable that is broader than the underlying concept. The analysis of human rights INGO effectiveness looks at a range of outcomes, including physical integrity rights and women's social, economic, and political rights, but the level at which these outcomes is measured is quite removed from the success or failure of individual INGO efforts and may be influenced by many other factors. This makes it harder to assess the success of INGOs within countries and across different types of projects. The evidence for service provision INGOs is narrower still as it is tested only on access to water, which, while declared the top global risk problem by the World Economic Forum in January 2015, might not represent the broader service sector.

Beyond these empirical findings about how NGOs are able to improve services and political freedoms in their host countries, Murdie also examines how NGOs respond to donor preferences. At its core, her formal model reflects a signaling game; in the absence of cheap and reliable information, INGOs must prove to their donors that they are respectable, trustworthy organizations. She argues that NGOs need to signal their accountability and effectiveness to their donors, an idea that ties directly to our framework in @fig:framework. She argues that NGOs signal their type by maintaining consultative status with the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), which aligns with the preferences and norms of their donors. Murdie describes the process of obtaining and maintaining ECOSOC status as "arduous and time-consuming," although it is worth noting that ECOSOC rarely turns down applications for consultative status.[^1] In both the service-provision and advocacy models, she finds a positive correlation with ECOSOC affiliation and better human security outcomes, suggesting that INGOs that appear to voluntary regular themselves and prove their accountability and trustworthiness receive more donor support and are substantially more effective. Like Bush, Murdie questions the assumption that INGOs are purely principled actors—not all NGOs go through the effort and work to prove their best intentions—and provides more formal evidence for the line of research started by @Cooley:2002. She carefully reframes the principledness of INGOs as yet another factor that influences their effectiveness rather than as an underlying assumption of their behavior.

Situating the book's findings in our framework raises additional questions about the effect of donor and host country institutional pressures on NGOs. For example, are INGOs aware of donor preferences when signaling, or are there information asymmetries? (i.e. do donors really care about ECOSOC status?) Beyond ECOSOC status, what other strategies can INGOs use to signal their deeper principles? Additionally, what is the relationship between general host country characteristics like corruption and the more specific regulatory and legal environment for INGO activities? Corruption and NGO restrictions likely correlate closely, but not in all cases—democratic countries with low corruption like Canada, Israel, South Africa, and the United Kingdom have each passed some of the civil society restrictions shown in @fig:constraint-data [@ChristensenWeinstein:2013].  Finally, as human rights and service provision organizations improve human security in the countries they target, does their work improve the regulatory environment in those countries? Does INGO success beget more success?

Murdie's book provides a serious and rigorous empirical contribution to our understanding of the effect of INGOs, makes excellent use of limited data, and offers a creative—and highly accessible—method for exploring the implications of a complex formal model. Her conclusions offer useful policy guidance for both donors seeking to support more accountable and effective NGOs and for NGOs hoping to have more impact within the constraints of their host countries.

# Avenues for future research

Taken together, these three books… summarize the framework, what they show about each…

## Donor side

Murdie and Bush both focus on the need of NGOs to please donors, but they stress very different signals. Whereas Bush stresses NGO efforts to deliver measurable results, Murdie focuses on NGOs effort to signal their type. Are both of these efforts actually in play at the same time, or can NGOs substitute one for the other? Or do donor demands vary across donors, perhaps based on the national origins of donor agencies [@Stroup:2012]?

Donors and Teets' consultative authoritarianism?

## Regime side

Murdie's division of her focus into advocacy and service NGOs raises the question of how target governments may be torn between regulating advocacy versus service NGOs. Murdie finds that advocacy INGOs are most effective in countries that play host to other internationally focused INGOs. She attributes this to the fact that this means that NGOs are working on issues that have broad, unified domestic support that other states, IGOs, and INGOs care about. However, it might also be due to more liberal regulations towards NGOs in those countries. Most regulations are generic so as to seem benign, but governments often retain significant discretion in how policies are implemented. The need for registration—a common element in repressive regulation—allows governments to select NGOs that can be active in their countries. 

However, an additional focus on the legal environment for NGOs working in the country might be helpful. China, for instance, is highly dependent on exports, but not very vulnerable to NGO pressure, because its legal restrictions on human rights advocacy prevent INGOs from acting effectively.

What happens when INGOs cannot temper the regulations of repressive regimes? When INGOs and domestic civil society have to conform to increasingly repressive regulations, how do they adapt? Do they tame their programming, á la Bush? If so, does that programming resemble the types of programs proposed by Bush as "regime compatible"?


# New stuff

Teets' *Civil Society under Authoritarianism* highlights one way the framework can be expanded. The dual institutional pressures on NGOs are not unidirectional—NGOs in China have consulted with the government in ways that have allowed them to directly shape and influence their regulatory environment. 

Influence of host countries on donors is unexplored; also, can NGOs influence donor culture and rules? Can they convince donors to not measure stuff, etc.?

Finally, the interactions between INGOs themselves influences their behavior. 

- Access to gatekeepers that aren't donors, but are issue gatekeepers [@Carpenter:2014]
- INGO bandwagon effect

Murdie's finding that INGOs are more successful when they go to countries where other INGOs also go, raises the question of whether the bandwagon effect simply proxies for some other unmeasured factors. That would be important from a policy perspective as the tendency for INGOs to serve countries where other INGOs are successful might lead to neglect of the countries most in need.
