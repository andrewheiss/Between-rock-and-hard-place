International NGOs face two competing constraints. Principled instrumentalism - constraints internal to the organization. Lots of stuff on NGO constraints. @MitchellSchmitz:2014 and principled instrumentalism = NGOs pursue principles, limited by instrumental concerns

Institutional constraints are also an issue - Donor regulatory environment + target country regulatory environment


{Literature on relationship between NGOs and the state; are they just extensions of the state or separate?}.

The preferences and behavior of both donor organizations and target countries have a direct influence on the strategies, activities, and effectiveness of INGOs. Wedged between two actors that are often at odds with one another, INGOs must carefully balance {blah blah… …}

Include figure of framework - top layer shows dual pressure—donor rules + institutions in target countries constrain what NGOs can do. Each of the books explore different aspects of this chain of influence

# The influence of donor norms

The preferences, rules, and institutions of donors comprise the first significant pressure on NGO activities and behavior. As a corrective to the overly optimistic conception of NGOs as altruistic, high-minded, deeply principled organizations positioned to address critical policy failures [@NyeKeohane:1971; @Skjelsbaek:1971; @Corry:2010], early research began to look instead  at how NGOs shift their priorities away from their core missions, values, and constituents in an effort to secure funding. For instance, in post-Soviet Russia, foreign donors interested in democracy promotion flooded the country's nascent civil society sector with millions of dollars of aid, leading to two diverging outcomes. Foreign donors enhanced NGO organizational capacity by providing them with substantial funding, equipment, and practical training. However, these efforts ultimately weakened the sector, as recipient NGOs linked themselves to foreign donors in patron-client relationships [@Henderson:2002]. Instead of a strong grassroots civil society with robust and independent NGOs, donors inadvertently created a "professionalized realm of NGOs, inaccessible to most local groups and compromised by its links to a neoliberal vision of development" [@Hemment:2004, 215]. Similar distortions—NGOs becoming overly linked to their donors—have occurred throughout the world, including Ghana, India, Mexico [@Townsend:2004], Palestine [Jamal:2007], and Haiti [@Schuller:2012].

In addition to restructuring social ties between recipients and their constituents, donors can also inadvertently create adverse NGO behavior by fostering competition for funding. As similar NGOs compete for the same sources of funding, organizations will often undermine their competitors, withhold information, or continue to work on failing (yet profitable) endeavors [@Cooley:2002]. Some NGOs may even exaggerate the severity of crises to obtain additional funding from donors [@CohenGreen:2012]. Though NGOs may initially be motivated by principled agendas, competition in the fundraising market can result in dysfunctional behaviors. NGOs do not operate in a meritocracy of policy issues, where the worthiest human rights and humanitarian problems are immediately supported by donors. Instead, INGOs compete in a "harsh, Darwinian marketplace where legions of desperate groups vie for scarce attention, sympathy, and money" [@Bob:2002, 37]. NGOs that use emotive marketing, employ native English speakers, use charismatic spokespeople, and align their messages with Western sensibilities are far more effective than their competitors at advancing their issues and securing funding from donors.

In *The Taming of Democracy Assistance*, Sarah Bush makes a novel contribution to this well-established field of donor–NGO research. Using a mix of statistical models and detailed case studies, Bush argues that democracy promotion NGOs must strike a delicate balance between the preferences of both their donors and the governments of the countries they work in. First, as a result of the measurement revolution in the development and democracy promotion sector, donor funding is now often contingent on evidence of program effectiveness. In order to prove this effectiveness, NGOs have adopted norms of professionalization, restructuring their core programming around logic models that quantify their inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes and allow them to make statistical evaluations of their programs to present to their donors. Second, international NGOs need to maintain a good relationship with the governments of the countries they target with their advocacy—if an NGO is too confrontational, pushes for too much reform, or poses other political risks to the ruling regime, it runs the risk of losing the ability to work in the country, which in turn weakens its ability to pursue its mission and obtain funding.

Bush argues that donor insistence on evidence-based programming creates disincentives for NGOs to engage in activities that are not easily measurable or that threaten NGO activities in the countries they work in. Rather than confront dictators with more radical programming, democracy promotion NGOs that are dependent on foreign donors engage in advocacy that is (1) measurable, thereby appeasing their donors, and (2) regime compatible, thereby keeping their host governments satisfied and allowing them to continue to operate. This mix of competing preferences creates a tamer, watered down version of democracy assistance that fails to provoke meaningful reforms or confront dictators. 

Throughout her book, Bush makes several important empirical and theoretical contributions. First, she notes that despite popular debate about democracy promotion, scholars know very little about how democracy assistance works in practice [@Bush:2015, 213]. She remedies this shortcoming by providing a rich description of how democracy promotion is carried out today, highlighting the work of dozens of donor organizations and NGOs through impressive fieldwork and primary research. Consistent with her theory, she bolsters her qualitative work by quantifying and statistically modeling measurability and regime compatibility of NGO programming, categorizing several thousand grants from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) in a typology of measurability and regime compatibility. Through this analysis, she uncovers one of the mechanisms behind the NGO scramble first theorized by @Cooley:2002, providing convincing evidence that the structures and institutions for grant-making directly shape NGO behavior.  Both competition *between* NGOs and professionalization *within* NGOs have substantive effects on the proportion of NGO programming that is measurable and regime-compatible—as organizations scramble among themselves for funds and as organizations become more professional, staffed by more graduate degree holders, NGO programing becomes more tame. 

These contributions, however, face some minor shortcomings. Though the book address both donor and host government constraints on NGO activities (i.e. both sides of @fig:framework), the bulk of the book's evidence is focused on the institutional pressures from donors, and not from host countries. Bush provides substantial evidence showing how donor preferences for measurable programs lead to a taming of democracy assistance, but the evidence regarding host-country pressure to be non-confrontational and non-threatening is much weaker. When government pressures are addressed, the evidence is either inconclusive or only lightly discussed. For example, in the statistical model explaining the determinants of regime compatible programming, both increased competition and professional norms—each aspects of the donor environment—influence the proportion of regime compatible activities, while democratization (as measured by Freedom House) surprisingly has no effect. We would expect that regime type *should* matter for the mix NGO programming, and the book's later case studies argue as much. Bush does acknowledge this non-relationship briefly and offers an alternative analysis using categorical regime types, but the absence of a significant statistical effect could perhaps be the result of how the model was structured. The model's key dependent variables—(1) the percent of large NGOs standing as a proxy for competition, and (2) the percent of professionalized staff—are identical in each country-level observation in each year and thus represent a steady time trend that captures no changes across countries. Given the stickiness of these important variables, alternative modeling strategies such as random country effects [@ClarkLinzer:2015] may provide more accurate estimates of regime type. 

At its core, Bush's argument is not necessarily about measurement or compatibility per se, but about survival. Survival strategies dictate NGO programming—NGOs measure their outputs and outcomes (and correspondingly tame their programming) because donors require it to receive funding, and NGOs ensure their programs are compatibly with the regime (and and correspondingly tame their programming) because host governments allow or deny access to their countries. Bush tackles two aspects of survival, but many other strategies remain unexplored and are ripe for future research. While NGOs are certainly driven by instrumental concerns like funding and access, they are also animated by deeper principled motivations [@MitchellSchmitz:2014]. Taming programming for the sake of obtaining funding will inevitably clash with NGO norms. How do NGOs balance the need for funding with the need to promote democracy, challenge undemocratic regimes, or bolster human rights? Do NGOs adjust their principles to square them with their principled behavior, or do they forgo funding or access to remain aligned with their ideals? Additionally, what other instrumental strategies can NGOs engage in? Rather than uniformly tame its programming, an international organization might shift its resources to other countries with more favorable regulatory environments. For example, the Open Society Foundations (OSF)—one of Bush's case study organizations—was expelled from Russia in 2015 after being deemed an "undesirable organization." Instead of taming its programming to stay active in the country, OSF moved its focus to other countries in the region, temporarily abandoning its Russia projects in favor of more effective advocacy and assistance elsewhere [@Heiss:2016b]. 

These questions are clearly beyond the scope of the book and are simply illustrative of fruitful future avenues of research. Bush usefully makes a strong argument for the first relationship in our framework, demonstrating how the donor environment shapes NGO behavior. Her treatment of the effect of the second relationship in our framework—how the target country environment influences NGO activities—is less robust and convincing, but it opens the door to future analysis. 


# The influence of the target-country legal environment 

In *Civil Society under Authoritarianism*, Jessica Teets addresses the second relationship in our framework, investigating how the preferences, politics, and legal environment of target countries shapes NGO behavior and programming. Throughout her book, Teets seeks to resolve a paradox: why does the Chinese communist party allow international advocacy NGOs to operate in their country? At first glance, it seems that autocrats concerned with survival would not willingly invite foreign organizations that could potentially destabilize and threaten the regime. However, the ruling party has allowed—and even encouraged—the development of foreign-influenced associational life within China. Teets' solution to this paradox is a new model of state–society relations she terms *consultative authoritarianism*, where autocrats encourage the development of a strong and autonomous civil society under the aegis of newer, indirect methods of state control. 

Scholars have identified dozens of authoritarian strategies for survival and stability, each instituted in a top-down manner by the regime. Previous research shows that dictators remain in power by countering threats to their rule with institutionalization. Autocrats establish institutions like consultative councils and executive cabinets to give voice to and build patronage with elites and create democratic-appearing institutions like legislatures, elections, or civil society to manufacture popular loyalty and mitigate threats from society or the opposition [@Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a; @Gandhi:2006; @GandhiPrzeworski:2007; @Brownlee:2007]. Teets' model of consultative authoritarianism falls in this theoretical strain and she shows that the Chinese government has institutionalized civil society in a way to maximize the benefits of NGOs while minimizing the risk. 

Teets helpfully expands this literature on authoritarian institutionalization by investigating the processes behind the creation of civil society regulations. The novelty of her new model of regulation lies in its consultative nature. Using carefully selected case studies of government officials and NGOs working in Yunnan, Beijing, Jiangsu and Sichuan provinces, Teets provides evidence that civil society regulations are not created unilaterally by the regime, but are instead the result of a bottom-up dynamic learning process *with* NGOs. According to her argument, policy makers and bureaucrats pressed for time and resources recognize that civil society organizations are useful potential partners in filling gaps in service delivery and policy execution—for example, provinces suffering from severe pollution can enlist the help of expert environmental international NGOs to address those issues. These bureaucrats also establish regulations that attempt to mitigate the potential threat inherent in turning to foreign organizations, including as tax laws, registration requirements, and other mechanisms for oversight and accountability. For their part, NGOs do not passively accept government overtures for collaboration, but instead become co-architects of the regulations [@Teets:2014, 145]. NGOs have a menu of strategies that allow them to create positive experiences for local officials and shape the civil society regulatory environment in beneficial ways. Organizations can invite government officials to conferences and workshops, hire retired government officials with connections to sitting bureaucrats, or publicly shame government agencies that impose harsher regulations. In turn, bureaucrats respond by modifying civil society regulations.

This dynamic, consultative relationship between the regime and NGOs is perhaps the book's most groundbreaking theoretical contribution. Teets convincingly demonstrates that government regulations on NGOs are indeed a constraint on NGO behavior, but that to a certain extent, NGOs can shape those regulations and constraints to their own benefit.

Teets makes a convincing case for consultative authoritarianism in China, but it is unclear how well the theory travels to other countries or policy issues. The book's final chapter briefly shows how the urge to regulate civil society has diffused across authoritarian regimes as dozens of countries have enacted laws similar to China's. Indeed, as we showed in @fig:constraint-data, regimes around the world—both democratic and authoritarian—have increased their regulation of civil society. However, not all of these new regulations are designed to allow autocrats to benefit from civil society. In an extended case study in the conclusion, Teets argues that Russia has followed a path similar to China, passing a law in 2006 (in partial consultation with domestic NGOs) that could have possibly strengthened civil society under conditions favorable to the state. However, more recent developments, such as Putin's passage of the 2012 Foreign Agents law and the 2015 Undesirable Organizations law weaken this argument. NGOs did not influence these newer, harsher regulations and Russia now has substantial power over organizations it deems threatening. 

Though it is exciting, the argument that INGOs have the ability to influence regulations is based on the experiences of a handful NGOs working on environmental issues. The absence of substantial exploration of the scope conditions of this phenomenon of reverse influence raises important questions to be answered in future research. When can INGOs working in other policy issues also influence the regulations that govern them? Can NGOs that advocate for more contentious issues, such as human rights, have similar success in consulting with their host governments? What are the consequences of collaboration with autocratic governments? How do donors respond when an NGO works closely with dictators? How do NGOs find the right balance between collaboration and independence?

## Other donor-based and target-country influences

*The Taming of Democracy Assistance* and *Civil Society under Authoritarianism* each clearly address individual institutional pressures on NGOs, effectively arguing that both the donor environment and the target country's regulatory environment constrain and shape NGO behavior. While these two books fit obviously in our simple dual-constraint framework, we believe that situating other research on NGO behavior within this framework can helpfully uncover more nuance on the effects of government regulations, norms, and institutions on NGOs. 

Amanda Murdie's *Help or Harm* begins with an ambitious goal of determining which conditions allow INGOs to successfully improve human security. Murdie separates the broad issue of human security into the dual freedoms from both "want" and "fear", which international NGOs address by engaging in service provision (to address want) or human rights advocacy (to address fear). She presents a creative formal game theoretic model to structure her analysis of of these two sectors—the book does not delve into mathematical analysis of this model, but instead uses the model's various equilibria to generate hypotheses about the motivations and influences of INGOs. The model does an excellent job at reinforcing the internal logic of the argument and makes the empirical analysis clear and easy to follow.

Using a set of statistical models, Murdie argues that service and advocacy INGOs have had measurable effects on human security outcomes, but under different conditions. Using the level of access to clean water as a proxy for success in service provision, freedom-from-want INGOs are most successful when they work in countries with better control of corruption, garner support from the international donor community, signal their accountability by obtaining consultative status with the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), and serve domestic populations that have access to global civil society and value the services provided. Murdie finds a different set of conditions for success in advocacy. Similar to their service providing counterparts, freedom-from-fear INGOs are more effective when they have ECOSOC consultative status and have closer connections with domestic populations (i.e. when the citizens of the countries they target have better access to information and contact with the global community). Additionally, these INGOs are most effective when addressing issues that have broad, unified domestic support and that other states, IGOs, and INGOs care about—notably, INGOs that work in countries that play host to other internationally focused INGOs have better success. Finally, INGOs see better human rights outcomes when working in countries that are more economically and politically vulnerable, or that are more dependent on trade and exports.

The book's emphasis on a handful of practical (and measurable) outcomes and influences reflects an unfortunate lack of INGO-related data in general (a fact with which we are both intimately familiar). Murdie admirably works with these limitations and justifies how each measure she uses can stand as a proxy for grander conditioning factors. However, even with these justifications, the book may at times oversell some of its conclusions. While the analysis of human rights INGO effectiveness looks at a range of outcomes, including physical integrity rights and women's social, economic, and political rights, the evidence for service provision INGOs is tested only on access to water, which might not be representative of the broader service sector. 

Beyond these empirical findings, which Murdie connects to brief policy recommendations, the book makes a crucial theoretical contribution by questioning the assumption that INGOs are necessarily principled actors and providing more formal evidence for the line of research started by @Cooley:2002. Murdie carefully reframes the principledness of INGOs as yet another factor that influences their effectiveness rather than as an underlying assumption of their behavior.  At its core, the Murdie's formal model reflects a signaling game; in the absence of cheap and reliable information, INGOs must prove to their donors that they are respectable, trustworthy organizations. INGOs that are able to prove their accountability and trustworthiness are substantially more effective. 

This idea of signaling is tied directly to our conceptual framework in @fig:framework—because the donor environment privileges accountability and effectiveness, INGOs change their behavior (in this case, by obtaining ECOSOC consultative status) to fit the norms of their donors. The positive effects of ECOSOC affiliation and international focus on effectiveness reveal underlying donor norms and preferences for a certain type of INGO, putting pressure on organizations to align themselves with the donor environment. Similarly, target-country characteristics such as urbanization, globalization, and dependency on aid and trade all represent a kind of pressure on INGO behavior, but less connected to a country's institutional environment. The target-country factors she identifies tend to be practical limitations on service provision and advocacy. For example, the only measures of target-country institutional barriers from the government's perspective are control of corruption (for service INGOs) and aid and trade dependency (for advocacy INGOs). Each of these reflect very real barriers to activities—countries with high corruption make effective service provision impossible, and countries that are not vulnerable to international shaming will not respond to global human rights campaigns. However, these practical limitations miss a latent institutional factor—the legal environment for NGOs working in the country. The regulatory environment for INGOs is not necessarily correlated with corruption or vulnerability and has a separate effect on INGO success. China, for instance, is highly dependent on exports and should theoretically be more vulnerable to shaming, but its legal restrictions on human rights advocacy prevent INGOs from acting effectively. 

Situating the book's findings in our framework raises additional questions about the effect of donor and target-country institutional pressures on NGOs. Beyond ECOSOC status, what other strategies can INGOs use to signal their deeper principles? Are INGOs aware of donor preferences when signaling, or are there information asymmetries? (i.e. How often do INGOs send signals that donors do not care about?) What is the relationship between general target-country characteristics like corruption and the more specific regulatory and legal environment for INGO activities? Finally, as human rights and service provision organizations improve human security in the countries they target, does their work improve the regulatory environment in those countries? Does INGO success beget more success?

# Avenues for future work

How the three books link together.

Influence of target countries on donors is unexplored; also, can NGOs influence donor culture and rules? Can they convince donors to not measure stuff, etc.?
